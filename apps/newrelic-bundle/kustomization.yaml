# --- Argo CD Sync Wave Strategy ---
#
# This kustomization uses Argo CD sync waves to solve a common
# "chicken-and-egg" problem with operator webhooks.
#
# The Problem: Admission webhooks must be patched with a 'caBundle',
# which is generated by a Job. But that Job can't run, and the
# operator pod itself can't start, if the webhook configuration
# is already active but failing (because it has no caBundle).
# This ordered sync breaks that loop.
#
# --- Sync Wave Breakdown ---
#
# Wave -10: Apply CRDs
#   - What: The 'instrumentations.newrelic.com' CustomResourceDefinition.
#   - Why: The cluster MUST know about the new 'Instrumentation' resource
#     type before anything else. We also patch 'spec/conversion'
#     to 'strategy: None' to prevent Argo CD and the operator
#     from "fighting" over this field (which you should handle with
#     'ignoreDifferences' in the Argo CD Application).
#
# Wave -5: Stage Operators and "Empty" Webhooks
#   - What: All RBAC, the operator Deployments (infra-operator,
#     metadata-injection), their Services, and their
#     MutatingWebhookConfiguration resources (still empty).
#   - Why: This creates all the necessary "targets" for the patch
#     jobs to find. The operators start deploying, and the
#     webhooks exist but are not yet active/blocking.
#
# Wave -4: Generate Certificates
#   - What: The '...-admission-create' Jobs.
#   - Why: These jobs run, generate TLS certs, and patch the
#     'caBundle' into the webhooks created in Wave -5. This makes
#     the webhooks "live". The 'Replace=true' sync-option
#     ensures new certs are created on every upgrade,
#     preventing TLS errors.
#
# Wave -3 & -2: Deploy the 'k8s-agents-operator'
#   - What: The main operator's Service (Wave -3) and then its
#     Deployment (Wave -2).
#   - Why: This operator can now safely start. Its own CRD
#     (Wave -10) exists, and the *other* webhooks (Waves -5/-4)
#     are now healthy and won't block its pod creation.
#
# Wave 5: Apply Custom Resource (CR) Instances
#   - What: The 'Instrumentation' CRs from 'instrumentation-crs.yaml'.
#   - Why: Apply the CR instances *last*. This ensures the operator
#     (from Wave -2) that manages them is fully running and ready
#     to process them immediately.

# Wave -3/-2: Other k8s-agents-operator components are created.
# Wave 5: Instrumentation CRs are created.
